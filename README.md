## ðŸš€ Concept

Web Rewind is a plugin for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) that allows you to see how websites looked like in the past. Internally, it uses [Archive.org](https://archive.org) to retrieve the snapshots of the websites with [FlashAPI](https://apiflash.com/dashboard/query_builder) to enhance the quality of the images presented in the chat UI.
