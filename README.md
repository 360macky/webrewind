  ChatGPT plugin that allows you to see how websites looked like in the past.

## 🚀 Concept

Web Rewind is a plugin for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) that allows you to see how websites looked like in the past. Internally, it uses [Archive.org](https://archive.org) to retrieve the snapshots of the websites with [FlashAPI](https://apiflash.com/dashboard/query_builder) to enhance the quality of the images presented in the chat UI.

## 🦾 How it works

Web Rewind is composed by the OpenAI plugin architecture, which is composed by a manifest, an OpenAPI specification and one API.

```
/.well-known
  ai-plugin.json
/api
  get-wayback-url.py
.gitignore
openapi.yaml
```

To make the plugin really fast, I decided to use only one endpoint to retrieve the snapshots of the websites with the URL and the date as parameters. Also, I use the power of [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction) to make the endpoint faster.
